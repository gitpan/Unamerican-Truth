        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">For 
          as long as I've been a creative person, which is as far back as I've 
          remembered, I've pondered the SOURCE of that creativity. <br>
          <br>
          </font>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">Recently, 
          I have realized that my creativity has gone out of control. Because 
          of my ideas, I have spent literally a decade barely scraping by because 
          I'm working on my dream - first <a href="http://www.webcom.com/cain" target="cain">my 
          band</a>, and then this website. A decade is a long time, and I'm at 
          a loss to explain my dreams anymore. <br>
          <br>
          </font>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">The 
          most difficult - and important - question in philosophy is simply this 
          - "Where do ideas come from?" It's from pondering this question that 
          all RELEVANT philosophy emerges. You can spout all your theories about 
          what happens when we die or whatever, and I won't really care. It's 
          the IDEA stuff that matters. <br>
          <br>
          </font>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">By 
          its ideas, a nation lives and dies. The reason this project is called 
          "unamerican activities" is that I sense that the seed of death has been 
          planted in this nation. While we're barraged with "ideas" through our 
          national obsession with mass media, these ideas simply do not have the 
          diversity and honesty that characterize a growing society. <br>
          <br>
          </font>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">Your 
          life may be good. I accept that. But in my opinion, most Americans are 
          NOT free to pursue their ideas. They don't have a context whereby their 
          ideas make sense; they have to go to work in order to pay rent, so they 
          don't have the time to flesh it out; they simply do not have the funds, 
          or they have no idea what a "business model" is. <br>
          <br>
          </font>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">I 
          am not simply prophesying doom for this country. I am saying that we 
          can diagnose and treat the illness in its early phases. In my opinion, 
          this project constitutes ROUTINE MAINTENANCE for the American dream 
          - because for so many people, this dream is but a fantasy. <br>
          <br>
          </font>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">Have 
          you ever felt CONTROLLED? Like, REALLY controlled - your choices and 
          your actions no longer spontaneously generating out of your own will 
          (or even your best interests). I feel controlled. I think that there 
          is some spiritual force out there that's making me write these words 
          to you. <br>
          <br>
          </font>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">This 
          force is not necessarily malevolent. I know that in my heart lie nothing 
          but the most pure of urges. I'm not out to harm anything - I honestly 
          believe that what I'm doing with Unamerican is one of the most patriotic 
          things that one can possibly do! But I'm in its thrall nonetheless.

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">I 
          can't stop coming up with ideas. I don't have the time to make all of 
          these ideas happen </font>
        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">(hell, 
        this website has languished unattended for MONTHS while I tried!). But 
        I don't really have control of the idea-generating part of my mind any 
        longer. <br>
        <br>
        </font> 
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">When 
          one is FED ideas, one can't very well take CREDIT for them, can one? 
          Well, I am telling you this - "I" did not come up with these ideas, 
          the ideas for my stickers, the ideas for my music - I CAN'T TAKE CREDIT 
          FOR ANY OF THESE IDEAS. I sort of want them to go away and let me take 
          charge of my own life once again. But that choice is obviously not mine 
          to make. <br>
          <br>
          </font>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">We 
          all think that, as a whole, "ideas" are "good". We're surrounded with 
          the triumphs of the idea-oriented world - every technology we use began 
          as an "idea". Therefore, are more ideas better? Or is it better to FOCUS 
          on ideas, having them SERIALLY so that you can concentrate on them one 
          at a time? <br>
          <br>
          </font>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">Ideas 
          obviously have their own pace, although the more people thinking about 
          them full-time (or - more importantly - on their OWN time), and the 
          more society rewards people who have them, the faster they tend to land.

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">What 
          if I told you that there is a satellite that's orbiting the Earth right 
          now that is firing these ideas into my fevered brain? I would sound 
          completely insane, wouldn't I? But the difference between a courageous 
          innovator and a madman is </font>
        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">very, 
        very small. And I think I'm somewhere in between. <br>
        <br>
        </font> 
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">I 
          am not a courageous person. I fear pain, I don't do well with stress, 
          and violent movies give me a headache. Yet I've had the balls to go 
          without a paycheck, to directly attack the enemies of freedom in blunt 
          words online, and occasionally to interfere with unjust situations. 
          Where did this courage come from? I look back on my life, especially 
          the highlights, and sometimes it feels like I wasn't even there. Perhaps 
          the satellite was controlling me? <br>

        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">(and 
        it's one I will support in the following document)life isn't much unless 
        it's informed with a higher purpose, a mission, a REASON to carry on that 
        transcends mere survival. People who have this kind of mission stand out 
        from the uninspired masses as if they have an aura. I like such people.

          Leave home. Create a story, don't just be a null. I am TELLING you to 
          do so - that way, you don't have to go through the internal questioning 
          that generally halts such attempts at achieving personal liberation.

          I give you one mission, my people, and that is to BE REMEMBERED. To 
          enjoy yourself, to create great stories, and to BE REMEMBERED. And not 
          to be alone, but to find each other, and together to create something 
          that deserves the name "god". <br>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">Perhaps 
          God doesn't exist, but wouldn't it be nifty if he did? I mean, he could, 
          you know, do our chores for us. He'd be a great housemaid, huh? He'd 
          be able to help us with our homework. I believe that through CREATION 
          we achieve a measure of divinity. <br>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">If 
          you accept that, if you WANT God to exist but cannot rationally accept 
          the concept of supernatural divine forces looking over us, the answer 
          is simple. Just keep learning. Learn how to make things, learn how to 
          create things, and read about those who've made history. At some point, 
          you will have learned enough, and from there, it's onwards towards infinity

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">Quick 
          disclaimer - sometimes when I talk about "god" i call it "him". Sorry. 
          I don't think God is a guy or anything. I don't believe that "he" exists 
          at all - but I DO know that my muse is so out of control that I must 
          be possessed. <br>
          <br>
          </font>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">Learn 
          this - if you've got to fail in order to succeed at something, FAIL 
          QUICK, LEARN A LOT, and HAVE FUN ANYWAY. In order to become skilled, 
          you've got to screw up a lot, so pick something that doesn't threaten 
          your health too much, dig? <br>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">Do 
          you know what a "distributed application" is? It's a computer program 
          that lets other computers handle the hard work of crunching data. I 
          think that divinity is such an application. Lots of people working on 
          the same thing, sometimes without even being aware that there's a larger 
          purpose to their creativity. <br>
          <br>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff"> 
          I think a lot of different people are - RIGHT NOW - working on creating 
          stuff. They go by mundane titles, such as "software engineer" or "zine 
          writer", but their real business, no matter what their training, is 
          the CREATION OF MAGIC. Through this magic, we breathe life into the 
          concept of divinity. <br>
          <br>
          </font>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">In 
          my opinion, "God" steals into this framework in surprise moments. One 
          minute you're noodling on your guitar, and the next you've suddenly 
          written a riff that turns into the anthem that frees and it is a shared 
          secret. It is a secret that we all understand, and for me, it is just, 
          well, what my life is about. <br>
          <br>
          </font>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">Potential 
          is a pain in the ass, that's for sure. It hypnotizes you into believing 
          that you're ALREADY THERE, that you ALREADY MATTER, when the reality 
          is that REALLY MATTERING is just the ENDPOINT of a long process. <br>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">So 
          if change is truly a process, not an event, how do we learn how to NOTICE 
          IT? Well, BEGIN WITH A ***BANG***, that's how! In other words: CREATE 
          AN EVENT TO REMEMBER THE PROCESS BY. <br>

        <li> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#ffffff">"Satan" 
          does not exist, but as a concept, he's useful. In my belief, "Satan" 
          is anything that HOLDS YOU BACK from being the interesting, noble and 
          fruitful person you were meant to be. For me, Satan consists of my own 
          low self-opinion and the resulting reification of that opinion by my 
          parents and others. I don't give a fuck what kind of money I've got 
          to spend to get rid of this problem. Money spent staving off Satan is 
          money that's well spent. <br>

          you can. <br>

          We only have a certain amount of time in this life to be productive 
          and to make a difference. You can't help anyone by sharing your fear 
          with them; you can only ask for their help. <br>

          Helping others is a great way to help yourself. Between two people, 
          potential multiplies logarithmically as long as potential is the goal 
          of the interaction. <br>

          and up 'til now I haven't been able to do so. I am going to try and 
          try and try and try until I finally break through, and that is something 
          I will not be able to shake until I die. <br>

          fuck that, but the point is that you either make history or are subject
